IDE: IntelliJ Community 2021.1 using JDK 11.0.11 and JavaFX SDK 11.0.2

How to start this program: Load the IDE using the above IDE information. Once loaded and configured, 
run Main. If program loads correctly, a pop-up will occur with a button "Launch Master Appointment 
Scheduler." Pressing that will load the login screen. Username is "test" and password is "test".

Additional Report: The third report I chose to run was a total number of appointments by customer 
displaying who the customers are along with the total amount of appointments they currently have 
scheduled. It is viewable in TableView after running a SQL query and lambda in the background.
